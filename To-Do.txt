1. Alice run "keyGen" stored in directory Alice.
2. Bob run "keyGen" stored in directory Bob.
3. Alice run "host" to host server.
4. Bob run "connect" to connect to server.
5. Bob enter a client name.
6. Bob run "gennonce" to generate random 4 byte nonce.
7. Bob run "sha1" to hash public key.
8. Bob sends (public key), (client name), (nonce), (SHA-1 hashed public key).
9. Alice run "sha1" to hash (bob's public key).
10. Alice run "verify" to match (bob's hashed public key) & (alice hashed bob's public key)
11. Alice send (nonce from bob) and "Verified".
12. Alice's terminal now shows client name and nonce.
13. Bob run "verify" to check (nonce) & (nonce from alice).
14. Bob send "Ready".
15. Alice run "genskey" and "sha1" to hash (session key) & (Alice's public key).
16. Alice run "encrypt" for (session key) with (bob's public key).
17. Alice send (Alice's public key), (Hashed Alice's public key), (Encrypted Session Key), (SHA1 hashed Session Key)
18. Bob verify (Alice's public key) with "sha1" matching.
19. Bob decrypt (Encrypted Session Key) then verify with "sha1" matching.
20. Bob use SEED encryption to encrypt "Acknowledge".
21. Alice use SEED decryption then send SEED encrypted "Ready".
22. Alice remake the session key.
23. Bob remake the session key.
